# koa-hello-world
after years of working with express, I've tried to experiment with koa a little.

### main assumptions I'm trying to prove:
- [ ] moving from express to koa is simple
- [ ] koa provides some sort of routing solution similar to express
- [ ] koa can work with promises OOTB
- [ ] simplicity of error handlers
